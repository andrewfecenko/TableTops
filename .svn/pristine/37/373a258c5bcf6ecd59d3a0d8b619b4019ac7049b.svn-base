OK, so what your going to need to install is just to get started on the models is:
Flask
Flask-SQLAlchemy 
flask-login
flask-bcrypt
flask-wtf
flask-whooshalchemy

If you have pip or easy_install, do something like
`pip install -r requirements.txt` or whatever the easy_install equivalent is like


your going to need to install postgresql (for mac i think postgress.app should do the job)

create a new database remmber the name for the next step

onece you have that set up, go to the config.py and set up the SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI (with your username, password and the name of your table)


this all runs on python 2.7

the front end can be be run with "python run.py" in the main forlder


i've created a request called "localhost:port/bind" that will bind the models to the database so you can check that its working. 

if this all seems like too much and you have no clue what is happening check out :
